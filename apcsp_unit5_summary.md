## Unit 5.1 - Harmful and Beneficial Effects of Innovations

### Daily Video 1

Summary:  

Innovations or new technology discoveries through computer programming
can both bring benefits and harm to the world. The way things are done is often
changed based upon those innovations. Not every outcome of a programmer's
creation will be thought out but how it's received will be different from person
to person. Innovations in the world of computing often bring changes to other
places in the world as well such as in health or art.  

Examples:  

*Multirotor*  
Harmful effects: flying in unregulated zones is illegal and dangerous, privacy
concerns Benefits: deliveries, find lost people, aerial photography made easier

*Wii Controller*  
Benefits: gets people playing video games
Harmful Effects: Broken TVs and injuries

### Daily Video 2

Key Terms: Internet, Dopamine, Social Media, Microtransaction,

Summary:  

When a programmer creates things, they often have an intended audience
and purpose to fulfill but this purpose can also be taken multiple steps
further. With that, their creation can be used in a way they never intended it
to do. For example, the internet was created for scientists but is now used by
almost everyone in the world for entertainment or work, but this could cause
anxiety or depression which the creator did not intend.  Microtransactions have
also been created in which people can purchase in-game currency. This could have
negative consequences such as developing a gambling addiction or a loss of a
large amount of money.

Microtransaction are trades inside games where you trade real life money for
in-game currency, cosmetics, or powerups.

Web applications cause dopamine feedback loops, depression, anxiety, etc.. think
TIK TOK PSA(“you’ve been scrolling for too long guy”) (Mariela)

Dopamine is a chemical that makes you feel good when you win which keeps you
wanting to play more.

## Daily Video 5.2 - Digital Divide

**The digital “divide”** refers to differing access to computing devices and the
Internet, based on socioeconomic (income level), geographic (where you live), or
demographic (who you are) characteristics such as your budget, the area of
reception, and the age or religion that restricts you to use it. In some
countries, computers are not common in rural areas that do not have many
websites for you to visit, primarily to protect and advocate for the government.
This government puts a high level of surveillance on the internet to do so.
Since only parts of the world have internet or computer access, the digital
divide raises issues of equity and influence, both globally and locally. The
main problem is equity to make sure everyone could be on a leveled playing field
rather than one side of the group having an advantage compared to the rest.

## Daily Video 5.3 - Computing Bias

**Computing Bias**: computing innovations can reflect existing human biases
written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovations.  Bias
is the personal feelings or prejudices of the people making the innovation.

Computing innovations can reflect existing human *biases* because of biases
written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation.
Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing
innovations as a way of combating existing human biases. Biases can be embedded
at all levels of software development. Computing innovations can refelct
existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in
the data used by the innovation.

Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing
innovations as a way of combating existing human biases

   Example: Netflix; acquires lots of data (mainly explicit data)

   **Explicit Data**: thumbnails, name, address, etc.  

   **Implicit Data**: types of shows you watch, genres, etc.

**Bias**: Netflix exclusives (shows only produced by Netflix); encourages you to
continue subscribing to them

Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing
innovations to eliminate bias

- Biases can be can be present at all levels of software development

- Catered to certain audiences (YouTube Kids vs. TikTok vs. Facebook)

Debatable Questions about computing bias:  
1. Enhancing or intentionally excluding?
2. Intentionally harmful/hateful?
3. Receiving feedback from a wide variety of people?
4. Google Home / Amazon Echo  

    Alexa/Echo: addressing bias towards native American/English accents by
    implementing more languages, and foreign accent recognition

## Daily Video 5.4 - Crowdsourcing and Data 

This video summarizes the widespread access and benefits to information and
public data. Some examples of **public data sets** available can be Kaggle, Google
Public Datasets, Data.gov, and your local government. Distributed Computing is a
method that donates spare computing power to help calculations. 

An example of **distributed computing** is a Stanford experiment named
Folding@Home which helps out with discovering protein folding. 

Examples of **crowdsourcing** are Spotify (collaborative playlists), Kickstarter,
concert tickets, bitcoin, etc.

**Crowdsourcing** - A method of obtaining information by enlisting the services of
a large number of people through the internet

Some innovations that have come from crowdsourcing are things like Spotify,
their collaborative playlists feature, their algorithm, and the metadata write
in, you put in info to describe a song and it gets approved by someone else,
like Wikipedia. There’s also crowdfunding in which everyone can donate to a
cause, like Kickstarter and IndieGoGo. 

**Blockchain** - A network of computers called nodes which all have the same
history of transactions so the database is spread across the whole network

**Public data sets** provide widespread access to data and information and that
those public data sets facilitate the identification of problems, solutions, and
dissemination of results. 

## Daily Video 5.5 - Ethical and Legal Concerns

This video is about the legal and ethical concerns of computing. Some of these
concern stems from others copying original work and presenting it as their own.

Key Terms:   

**Intellectual Property**: A work or invention that is the result of creativity
which the one who created it has a right to.

**Copyright**: Protects IP by not allowing others to use it unless you give them
permission.

**Creative Commons**: Free licenses that allow others to use the IP but with clear
instructions on what others can or can not do with the IP. Such as not allowing
commercial use of a logo.

**Open Source**: Programs that are available for anyone to use and is able to be
redistributed and modified.

**Open Access**: Research online that are free of any copyright or license
restriction.

**Plagiarism**: Using someone else's work as your own.

**Digital Divide**: An unequal distribution of access to technology.

## Daily Video 5.6.1 - Safe Computing

When searching through the web it’s always good to keep in mind about what websites
you enter that may be harmful.  Your personal information could be used to
impersonate or steal information like your credit card number. It’s difficult to delete
information that was already submitted in a website because all the information has
been stored in the website. Everyone from Google to the government sees what you're
doing and to know if what you're doing is harmful to them or illegal. 

**Search history** let’s some of people who own the website know what you’re trying to find and put up
advertisements to get your attention on their products. The Internet is full of data
collection: some which are useful such as an online job application or school enrollment form, but
sometimes it could be used for the wrong purposes, to steal your
information from small personal information to sensitive personal information.

**Cookies**: Cookies are small pieces of information that have advertisements and small
pop ups that appear in other websites that advertise what you're trying to find in other
websites.

**Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**: specific to an individual; data that links to
someone; social security number, age, race, credit card information

   - Can be used by people to steal someone’s identity to commit bank fraud, etc.
   - Search engines maintain a history of what you search; you history is used to suggest
    other websites (targeted ads)

**Search engines** like Google  
- Collect a history of what you search
- Suggests other websites that the user may show interests in
- Can even collect your current locations

Pros and Cons (PII)  
- Can be used to enhance a user’s online experience
- Can be exploited if privacy and other protections are ignored; information placed online
can be used in ways that were not intended; harmful impacts

Examples   
- Planning a trip, didn’t tell anyone; Google knows you’re going on a trip because it knows
your IP address, and where and when you want to go; tracks your online behavior with
everything you do digitally.

#### Authentication measures

- Protect devices and information from unauthorized access
- Strong passwords
 -10 or more characters - Contain symbol, number, both lowercase and uppercase
letters

#### Multi-factor authentication

- Based off of passwords, answers to security questions,
what you are, and biometric data (eye scan, palm print,
thumbprint, or a keycard)

- Ex.) When you enter a password on your computer and it
sends a notification to your phone for your fingerprint to
gain another level of authentication and security

#### Virus and Malware

Key Terms:

**Virus**: Malicious programs that copy themselves and gain access
to systems without authorization

**Malware**: often intended to damage a computing system or take
partial authority over operation

Viruses can gain access by pretending and attaching itself to be a legitimate
program on other programs (ex. email attachment)

Virus scans can help prevent suspicious activity attacking your
system’s code and getting in

#### Encryption and Decryption

Once legitimate access to a system is gained, it is important to
ensure data sent to and from the system remains
uncompromised

Key Terms:

**Encryption**: the process of encoding data to prevent
unauthorized access

**Decryption**: the process of decoding data

**Symmetric Encryption**: one key used to both encrypt and
decrypt data

   - (ex.) Caesar Cipher)
   - Ex.) mjqqt → (5) hello

**Asymmetric Encryption** (Public Key Encryption): uses two keys

**Public Key** (anyone has access to) for Encrypting and
**Private Key** for Decrypting

- A sender does not need receivers private key to encrypt messages
- A receiver’s private key is required to decrypt a message
- Impossible to crack this encryption without the second private key

**Digital Certificates**

- Issued to validate ownership of those keys
- Linked to places where data is stored (websites)
- Can be viewed in web browsers
- If the certificate is out of date or invalid, you will receive a pop up
warning, usually indicating that it is unsafe

#### Daily Video 5.6 Daily Video 3

Key Terms:  

**Phishing**: An attempt to trick a user into providing personal information, like your usernames and
passwords, account numbers, or social security numbers.

**Keylogger**: Records every keystroke made by a user in order to gain fraudulent access to
passwords or other confidential information.

*Rogue Access Point*: A wireless network that can give unauthorized access to secure networks.
A phishing attack attempts to trick a user into providing personal information, which can lead to
access to online account resources such as your bank or email. 

Phishing emails masquerade as emails from companies you know and trust. They
trick you into opening an attachment or clicking on a link. The use of a program
to record every keystroke made by a computer user in order to gain fraudulent
access to passwords and other confidential information is known as keylogging. 

Unsolicited emails, attachments, links, and forms in emails can all be used to
compromise a computing system's security. These can be sent by unknown senders or known
senders whose security has been compromised. Untrustworthy (often free) downloads from
freeware or shareware sites may contain malicious code such as malware.
